Hi! I'm Xiaoxue Leng (ÂÜ∑ÊôìÈõ™). Xiaoxue can be interpreted as "Snow in the morning" or "We know snow is coming"‚ùÑÔ∏è in Chinese, and Leng means "Cold"ü•∂. 
<br/>

## Background

I received my bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees in Psychology from Central China Normal University. From 2020 to 2024, I worked in the [Learning and Child Development Lab](https://fxwang1.wixsite.com/landcdlab) with [Dr. Fuxing Wang](https://psych.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1132/5162.htm), where I explored how to support learning in technology-based environments and examined the cognitive and metacognitive processes underlying learning. Much of my work involved conducting experiments using methods such as eye-tracking and fNIRS.

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Education (Learning Sciences and Psychological Studies) at UNC Chapel Hill. I work as a research assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Matt Bernacki](https://ed.unc.edu/people/matt-bernacki/). My research focuses on understanding students‚Äô self-regulated learning behaviors and developing, testing, and implementing effective interventions to support self-regulated learning in real classroom settings.

In addition, I collaborate with [Dr. Ziyi Kuang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ziyi-Kuang) to investigate how generative learning activities can support student learning, and with Guohao He to examine the influence of parental growth mindset on students‚Äô academic achievement and beliefs.

*I am open to collaborations. If you share similar research interests, I would be happy to connect and explore potential opportunities to work together.*

## Research Interests

***How to help students learn more effectively?*** 

This question drives my research.

Early in my work, I believed the answer lay in improving instructional design, identifying effective learning strategies, and training students to use these strategies. I spent considerable time on exploring these issues. However, through a series of experiments in a large-scale project, I discovered that although students benefited from applying learning strategies in the laboratory, they often reported being unwilling to use them in their everyday learning.

This finding led me to a new line of inquiry: If effective learning strategies exist but students rarely apply them in real life, what holds them back? Why are students reluctant to use these strategies? And how can we encourage them not only to practice these strategies in controlled settings but also to adopt them actively in their daily learning? These questions have gradually shaped the next stage of my research interests.

Looking ahead, my work aims to bridge the gap between knowing and doing in students' learning. I am particularly interested in understanding the cognitive, motivational, and contextual factors that influence whether students choose to apply effective strategies in authentic settings. By combining laboratory-based experiments with classroom-based interventions, I seek to design and test approaches that not only improve students‚Äô self-regulated learning but also make these practices sustainable in real educational environments. Ultimately, my goal is to generate insights that inform both theory and practice, contributing to learning sciences research while providing evidence-based guidance for educators.

# üìë Projects 

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **How Generating Gestures Improve Children‚Äôs Memory on Spatial Information?**
- Explored the impact of gesture production on children‚Äôs memory on spatial information.
- Investigated the *Representational Mapping Hypothesis*, examining how different types of gestures facilitate recall of location and route information among young children.
- Conducted two experiments with a total of 168 4- and 5-year-old children and analyzed data.
- Findings showed that producing gestures improved children‚Äôs memory, with pointing gestures enhancing location memory and directional and tracing gestures boosting route memory.
- Currently drafting a manuscript for publication.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **No Need for Webcams with Synchronous Online Learning**
- Investigated the impact of teachers‚Äô and students‚Äô webcam use on synchronous online learning.
- Collected data from 33 college students, and recorded videos of learning processes.
- Applied motion energy analysis to examine students' movement and utilized FaceReader to assess emotional responses.
- Findings suggested students performed better when the instructor turned off the webcam and felt happier when they turned off the webcam.
- Reviewed and edited the manuscript submitted to a journal.
