Hi! I'm Xiaoxue Leng. Xiaoxue can be interpreted as "Snow in the morning" or "We know snow is coming"❄️ in Chinese, and Leng means "Cold"🥶. I'm going to pursue my PhD degree in the US this year!

I've got my bachelor and master degree in psychology from Central China Normal University. From 2020 to 2024, I worked in [Learning and Child Development Lab](https://fxwang1.wixsite.com/landcdlab) with [Dr. Fuxing Wang](https://psych.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1132/5162.htm). During this time, I focused on exploring ways of supporting learning in the technology-based learning environment and understanding cognitive (and metacognitive) processes of learning. I primarily conducted experiments with various techniques (e.g., eye-tracking, fNIRS) in the labs.

At present, I still work closely with Dr. Fuxing Wang, together exploring how gestures help children to memorize spatial information. Meanwhile, I'm collaborating with [Dr. Ziyi Kuang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ziyi-Kuang) on several projects.

# 🔥 News
- *2025.04*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 A new paper has published in Learning and Instruction!! In this paper, we focused on the effect of instructor presence and student presence in synchronous online classes on learning. Click [link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2025.102131) to have a look! 🎉🎉
- *2025.03*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 I got admitted by Education PhD program (Concentration: Learning Sciences and Psychological Studies) in University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I'll join this program in 2025 Fall and start to work with Dr. Matt Bernacki there.🎉🎉

# 📑 Projects 

## 1️⃣ **How Generating Gestures Improve Children’s Memory on Spatial Information?**
- Explored the impact of gesture production on children’s memory on spatial information.
- Investigated the *Representational Mapping Hypothesis*, examining how different types of gestures facilitate recall of location and route information among young children.
- Conducted two experiments with a total of 168 4- and 5-year-old children and analyzed data.
- Findings showed that producing gestures improved children’s memory, with pointing gestures enhancing location memory and directional and tracing gestures boosting route memory.
- Currently drafting a manuscript for publication.

## 2️⃣ **No Need for Webcams with Synchronous Online Learning**
- Investigated the impact of teachers’ and students’ webcam use on synchronous online learning.
- Collected data from 33 college students, and recorded videos of learning processes.
- Applied motion energy analysis to examine students' movement and utilized FaceReader to assess emotional responses.
- Findings suggested students performed better when the instructor turned off the webcam and felt happier when they turned off the webcam.
- Reviewed and edited the manuscript submitted to a journal.
