Hi! I'm Xiaoxue, an incoming phd student. I've got my bachelor and master degree in psychology from Central China Normal University. From 2020 to 2024, I worked in [Learning and Child Development Lab](https://fxwang1.wixsite.com/landcdlab) with [Dr. Fuxing Wang](https://psych.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1132/5162.htm). During this time, I focused on exploring ways of supporting learning in the technology-based learning environment and understanding cognitive (and metacognitive) processes of learning. I primarily conduct experiments in the lab setting with various techniques (e.g., eye-tracking, fNIRS). In the future, I want to utilize different methods and focus on more authentic learning contexts.

At present, I still work closely with Dr. Fuxing Wang, together exploring how gestures help children to memorize spatial informtion. Meanwhile, I'm collaborating with [Dr. Ziyi Kuang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ziyi-Kuang) on several projects.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Projects
**How Generating Gestures Improve Children‚Äôs Memory on Route Information?**
- Explored the impact of gesture production on children‚Äôs memory on route information.
- Investigated the Representational Mapping Hypothesis, examining how different types of gestures facilitate recall of location and route information among young children.
- Conducted two experiments with a total of 168 4- and 5-year-old children and analyzed data.
- Findings showed that producing gestures improved children‚Äôs memory, with pointing gestures enhancing location memory and directional and tracing gestures boosting route memory.
- Currently drafting a manuscript for publication.
